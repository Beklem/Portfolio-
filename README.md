# Portfolio-
Current draft of my portfolio website!

Please understand that a) this is a very rough draft and b) a humble project to get me started with to categorise other projects. I do have an idea of how to improve this one massively and creatively but I am looking to prioritise understanding beloved javascript at the moment....  I think having understanding of how to use javascript will really help in the next rendition of this portfolio.
